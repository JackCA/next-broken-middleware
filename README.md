this is a simple app that has two sets of middleware, one at the top-level and one at the root of a dynamic top-level namespace that rewrites with a prefix to another directory

clicking any link will trigger a full page reload (with a 404 on a chunk directly prior)

this does not happen in next.js 12.0.9
